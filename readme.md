## 💡 About

**DeepTime** is a modern, open-source Chrome extension that helps you reclaim your focus and productivity by blocking or allowing distracting websites during your chosen focus sessions. With a beautiful Material-inspired UI, DeepTime lets you easily toggle between blocklist and allowlist modes, track your productive time, and manage your site lists, all with privacy as a top priority.

## 🔒 Privacy


DeepTime is privacy-first:
- No analytics, tracking, or data collection.
- All settings are stored locally using Chrome's `storage.sync`.
- No data ever leaves your device.
